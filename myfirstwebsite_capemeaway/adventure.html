            <p>
                 Kalkbay is a little treasure not too far a drive away from the city. First of all the drive up there
                 is absolutely breathtaking, so that's already worth the trip. When arriving in Kalkbay there are many
                 cute little shops selling all kinds of souvenirs. For lunch you might want to consider the Brass Bell, a restaurant
                 overlooking the ocean where they serve the absolute best sea food in the area. After dinner, definitely
                 pop by Cape of Cuba, where you can have a nice spicy mango margherita with your toes in the sand. For more information

 <div class="kayaking"><h5>Kayaking</h5>
    <p>
        Of course there are a lot of Safari's available in South Africa, but what would you 
        think of exploring the sea life as well? Instead of taking a big boat, grab some kayaks
        and go out on the ocean to see what all lies beneath the water. Besides the beautiful view of
        the coastal lines and the majestic mountains you can see from the water, don't be surprised
        to spot pinguins, sealions, dolphins and even whales on your kayaking adventure. We highly recommend to 
        go on an early cruise for sunrise to watch the sun pop up behind the mountains to turn the water surface a 
        shiny golden. Book your kayaking experience <a href="https://kaskazi.co.za/n" title="Kayaking Company">here!</a>
